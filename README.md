My Sticky Notes’ mission is to help students manage their information more easily. Notes, reminders, lists……My Sticky Notes helps you keep track of all of these visually on a single online canvas instead of notes stuck to your computer, desk or fridge.

In this repository, you will find 2 folders: Desktop & Mobile Version. The only difference between them is that some features, such as a custom right click menu, that only works in desktop version. So in the Desktop Version, a right click menu is used to edit and delete notes; however, in the Mobile Version, the user can edit directly and double clicks to delete notes.
